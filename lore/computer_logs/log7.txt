They got me.
The bots — I didn’t see it coming. I was careful. Damn it ,I WAS careful. I thought I could slip past them. There were infected — just a few — I overestimate myself. I’m under some maintenance shafts again. Sealed the entrance behind me. It won’t hold long.

They knew.
They knew I was heading for the engine. Of course they did.
I can’t make it there. There's a pool of blood here. I can barely think straight. I don’t have much time .I uploaded everything — all my journal logs — into the main server. Maybe they’ll reach someone. If you’re hearing this, if you’re reading this…

God, I hope you are. If you’ve made it this far, I’m so glad, -would probably be impressed too if I'm not reduced to pile of bones by the time you get here. Or worse..

Listen to me — get to the end of the ships electrical corridor , its just above. You have to reroute all the power in the ship right back to the reactor, the overload should turn it from reactor to atom bomb. you have to finish this. You have to save them. No one else is left. Please… don’t let this all be for nothing.

Don't let me be for nothing.
Please.
