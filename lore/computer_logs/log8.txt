These things are extremely smart. We thought of it as a standard parasite but these operate in groups, almost helping each other. Even the way they... mutilate us is deliberate. From what i have observed there are 3 types.

Type -1:

Only has the upper half of the human body with a head and only one long arm petruding using some of the upper ribs as extensions for their "claws" .They seem like dead remains. SEEM.

Type 2:

the lower half of the body with the other arm and parts of the abdomen. It rushes toward its victims with no regard for itself.
type 1 and 2 and 2 halves of the same body. Essentially doubling their numbers from the amount of infected. But the last infection form is much different

Type 3:
Its an unholy abomination of flesh and guts. Nothing about it is even recognizable as once human. It can overpower multiple people at once , with its giant mouth it can swallow an entire person whole and those oddly shaped legs help it charge at its victim in mere seconds.

Keep in mind its a bloodborne plague all it needs to do is make u bleed and hold you long enough to transmit the disease. Back on earth any infected person took a few days at the very least to turn. But from what i see here it doesn't even seem take longer than a few minutes.
I think how fast you turn depends on the dose of infected blood, not too sure. Can be anywhere from a minute to hours or even days.
