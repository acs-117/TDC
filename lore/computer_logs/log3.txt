I found her. Curled up in a closet . A hole where her face used be and all the flesh in her body gone. The bastards probably took it as biomass for some other abomination because her little body alone isn't strong enough to tackle grown ups. I had no hope to begin with.

I don't know what to do. Fighting those things is useless. and even if by some miracle we got there safely what do i even have left. There's still some people here. Doing all they can to live. Judging by the screams i doubt they will last too long. They will get into this room soon enough. I don't want my body being used as a puppet.

We started prototyping plasma based weapons a few weeks ago because it was more efficient at dealing with those "things" than your usual bullets because what use is a bullet when the target doesn't care whether there is one hole in them or a hundred. plasma makes things simpler by just melting chunks of them off.

One shot to the head should be painless enough i hope. Ill make it quick.
