I miss home so badly. how normal and routine everything used to be. There was still the fear of war ,but still. I didn't value it enough when i had it. My little girl is strong despite all the shit she's been through- we've been through. Wish her mom could've been alive seen it . But on second thought, at least she didn't have to see the world end.

I always imagined how it may go. Maybe it would just light up in flame and take everything with it in one foul swoop. Nuclear weapons erasing us all in seconds. or hell maybe even an asteroid.

What i never imagined is it being so....slow. so gradual. We knew about the  What the Antarctic research station found. how quickly they were wiped out. We followed protocol to a tea ...and even after all that we had to initiate "the doomsday contingency". We never really stood a chance.

Some of these things made it down to the engine room. The pistol is keeping me alive for now but i doubt things will be so easy when i go up. Something is off this virus. Other than the obvious fact that this is the deadliest infection mankind has ever encountered that is. That attack on the control room was way too well coordinated for a just a brain dead disease and the security bots malfunctioning that exact second? couldn't have been random. There has to be something we don't know yet

The damn elevators broken down. Shit, i have to get up there as soon as i can. She must have hid somewhere safe right. Please just a little longer.
