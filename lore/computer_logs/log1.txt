I cant believe it. one second I'm in the control room discussing the housing upon arrival and the next, I had blood—pieces of people—stuck to my coat.

Everything happened in an instant. One of the doctors from the lab i think - burst into the room. The moment we saw his face we knew -there's no mistaking it. He's infected.

Everyone froze. Just for a breath. And then all hell broke loose. Weapons were drawn, people screaming—gunfire everywhere. But it didn’t matter. The more they fired the more of those things started coming in. the security bots started going crazy and firing randomly for some reason.  Some of us probably got eaten too. I didn't look twice.

I didn’t think. I just moved. Slipped into the maintenance vents in between all that panic. Some poor mechanic fell into the vents with me,
he was out cold. I couldn't take him with me so i just hid him in the vents. He should be safe until he wakes up. 

This is too much to take in. The tanks were sealed ,the subjects were sedated too for gods sake. This shouldn't be possible. Thank god I have the photon pistol on me at least. I could burn through the lower bulkheads and get to the engine room.

I have to get the residential block. Please… let her be alive.
