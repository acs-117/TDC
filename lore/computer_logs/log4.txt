Cant do it. Damn it. I have been hearing screams for the last 10 minutes. How the hell did it come to this. We followed protocol to complete perfection , the grand "doomsday contingency". "immediate evacuation of earth's entire population on the event of extinction". heard it a hundred times before all the way since college. Although then we never expected any disease being the reason for it to be called. 

Nothing left for me anymore , but i can try to save some of these people. I have to. Ill take down as many of these creatures as i can with me.

We cant fight against those things ,even the security bots are out of our control. What can i even d- Wait I think i know what to do. I have to send a distress signal to any nearby ship. Only way we stand a chance. I have to get to the nav room. Should be able to access the comms from there.
