Shit. The clever bastards broke the navigation and comms console. I cant send any signal. The navigational data has been changed as well.
Changed to the greater lunar colony. Wait...this cant be some mistake. No...no..no they did this on purpose , they know this side has a higher population.

How....HOW- I thought we knew what these things were. 
Oh my god. Everything we thought about the virus is wrong. We thought they were ONLY a parasite. But no , everything I'm seeing one after the other after the other.. after the other. They are frighteningly intelligent. From hacking the security bots to changing nav data and PRETENDING to be sedated to get to the moon. They must be interconnected somehow ,they work together flawlessly without any verbal communication. 

We are doomed. Earth wont survive ....and if this ship gets to the moon , it wont either.

Cant let this ship get to there. The comm systems are out. I cant give any warnings. But i cant risk any of them taking the virus with them.
There is no other way i have to rig this ship to blow. The fusion reactor in the engine rooms below the armory should do the job. I don't know how many are alive but i cant take any risks. Its for the greater good. I hope they can forgive me..
