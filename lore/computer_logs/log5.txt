The Research lab is just ahead. This is where it all started. We tried to warn them. Taking our research subjects with us was a risk. No matter how well contained they were. Turns out they weren't well contained at all. At least they didn't break out after reaching the lunar colony.

The Ships diagnostics show that the air filtration systems are cooked. There is an extremely high concentration of benzene in the air.
Anyone that goes in without protective gear is dead.

Ill need to lead any rescue efforts over here if i were to find a ship that responds to our signal. There should be some hazmat suits in the armory. I doubt the main entrance is accessible. Only way to make it through would be through the vents under the control room.

This doesn't make any sense. I saw the security camera footage those things are still in there not unconscious.
This shouldn't be possible the gas should sedate or kill them too.

Only way any of this tracks is if they were...pretending to be sedated in those tanks. But- no that shouldn't be possible. Oh god no..
