the " human relocation " line up of space cruisers made by cosmotech were extensively used in the 2080's during the mass relocation of human volunteers to set up colonies on the moon and mars. the numbers are approximate but there is said to be only 24 of these ships made all over the world as it cost a hell of a lot to make due to their fusion powered engine and just the sheer scale and amount of energy required for it to run.

after the relocation program ended the ships were mostly dormant and only put to use during massive tours at times considering there are smaller and cheaper options for travel now.

now in 2107 we are on board one of these ships not exactly as volunteers but because there is no other choice. immediate alert was issued by the united earth republic to evacuate every citizen in southern australia due to the breakout of the infection.  


ships design:

engine room:
supplies power and water to the whole ship for the duration of the travel and holds the giant nuclear fusion engine to keep the ship running. there is a team of some of the best mechanics for any case something goes wrong
