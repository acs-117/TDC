the infection attacked quickly and ruthlessly

turning every resident against you 

no one in the ship survived the attack

the people in the lunar colony will think of the explosion as some sort of engine malfunction

your courage and sacrifice will not be known

but you will rest easy knowing

your actions today have allowed humanity to live another day
