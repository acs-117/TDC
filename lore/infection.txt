An infection discovered in the coldest depths of antarctica keeping at bay an evolutionary "cure" to the human race . It is the wrath of nature only held back for centuries by nature itself now unleashed due to human curiosity.

On September 2106 an archeological discovery was made in antarctica this disease not known at the time lead to symptoms similar to that of alziemers, anywhere from 2 weeks to a month after the disease is contracted and later completely takes over the persons mind to serve only a collective conciousness that cares little for humans

stage-1:
completely invisiable the person or people around them has no idea the horror to come.

stage-2:
symptoms of the disease begin to emerge. Memory loss, a loss of cognitive ability and even pain in certain parts of the body. 

stage-3:
constant twitching, a complete loss of fine motor control and no ability to recall previous memories and petrutions in certain areas such as the side of limbs causing multiple fractures. at this stage they are essentially a walking corpse .the person is basically aldredy dead ,only traces of them remain but even at this stage they are very well aware of their situation and things going on around them.

stage-4:
hostility toward every human around them. The person is compeltely lost at this point nothing of what they used to be,remains. due to the damages in their body they have impaired vision so they will not easily spot you. Their physical appearence is completely altered as they look like a corpse with petruding bones and bits of flesh all around their body. But they will stop at nothing to either kill or convert you. at this stage it is unclear whether the patient can still understand whats going on around them or whether they are still somewhat consious but whatever may be the case their body isnt theirs anymore.
